Andrea: Hello everyone. I guess tha club fair must have gone very well, and I'm actually very excited because I never expected
        to seethis many people infornt of me like I do in this room before. Tell Your friends I want more.
Jonah: Yes--
Nigel: I'm Nigel Armstrong, and this is Andrea.
<Someone walks through the door>
Andrea: You made it yes!
Jonah: Oh hey..


Semester Overview
*****************

Andrea: I wanted to start out by saying a few of the things we want to get done this semester.
        The first thing is: Successfully organize our ever famous Lan Party, and the Game for it.
        The ACM Programming competition is coming up, and you should have gotten an email about it from Aron Khoel. You should 
        sign up for that. You get free ACM membership if you do it. So it's worth your time. You don't even have to do well.
        You can completely fail, and you still get food, and membership.
Jonah: Like Nigel did last year.
Andrea: Like we all did. He was the only team that got one
Nigel: We did pretty good. Yeah. the only CNU team that got one.
Andrea: I do want to put some focus on the Cyber Security, but that's not for me to talk about. Wait, I'm the president, yes,
        yes it is. We will also be trying to ressurect Replay for Life. If you're interested in doing Charity Video game speed
        runs, please come up to the front after this and we will look into signing you up.
        
Vice President Absence  (Vote involved)
**********************

Andrea: Very important, So our vice president Richard Harrah, is no longer a full time student. So according to our current
        Bi-Laws, he can no longer be the vice president. We have been discussing what we want to do about this, and I want to
        get your guys' opinion. Would you like a new Vice president? Or would you like to ammend the Bi-Laws to allow him to
        remain vice president for the rest of the term?
<Person Shouts Ammend!>
Jonah: That's a really long process. We don't have time.
Andrea: What Ammending?
Jonah: Yeah.
Andrea: Ammending the Bi-Laws means that I have to say, next meeting we are haveing a Bi-Law ammendment meeting, and we have
        to discuss ammending the Bi-Laws.
Jonah: What was it so complicated when Gerald did it?
Andrea: Because Gerald.
<laughter>
Andrea: Just show up hands: Who wants a new vice president.
Andrea: Who wants to make things easy and change the rules so we can keep our vice president.

<-------    Amendment Meeting Vote Raised in: [Ammendment meeting vs. Voting in new VP] --------->
<-------   Vote: 3-8 for Ammendment meeting. --------->

Andrea: Okay so next meeting, Tuesday the 8th we will have a Bi-Law ammendment meeting, so come with your voting pencils.
        I will also have pencils.
< Question: So only official members can vote. >

Andrea: Yes, if you pay your dues, and give us your membership number and we have that on record, you can vote.
        Everyone else can just give moral support.
Jackie: You can pay your dues right now by the way, and that way you can vote next week.
        They're $20.00
Jonah: Just go to the website--
Andrea: Yeah, for students, it's significantly less expensive than if you're not a student.

IEEE Explanation
****************

Nigel: You should also join the IEEE as a Member.
        It's more expensive than the ACM, but the great thing about the IEEE, is that if you pay, you get access to the IEEE
        LIbrary, and the IEEE Library is one of the greatest resource centers for computingthat there is. Almost every single
        Computing paper ever written is in that Library. Almost all of them, except for the few that go to the ACM.
        That's one of the advantages of the IEE, is it's extensive Library, so--
<Gerald Walks in>
Jonah: Gerald...
Andrea: I don't think you can be here sir.
Gerald: I just wanted to stop--
Andrea: Nah, this is a student event.
Nigel: Yeah.
Andrea: So anyways, I will get back to your guys comments, after we hear from Nigel about the IEEE.

IEEE Portion Start
==================

Nigel: Okay, so there's our QR code. I think it works.
Jonah: Not as many blocks so...
Nigel: Yeah, so, IEEE, what we are going to try to do is to work on an internet if things project this semester. So we will
        try to get that done. We will also be looking at some ESPA-266 modules to work with those, and doing something with
        those. Their little electronic modules, and they're pretty awesome.
        We are going to help the ACM with their Lan Parties, and I think that is what we will be focusing on.
Andrea: Nice, so the enxt thing is Cyber Security.
Jonah: Wow, okay, Hey, I'm Jonah Lazar. I'm the Treasurer of the ACM, The Linux User Group, but not the IEEE. Come to the 
        Linux User Group if you want to learn to use Linux, or already use linux, they're great.
        So last year we had a hacking competition, and this year we want to have another one, which will be different. Kind
        of the same thing, we want to get computers, and have a CTF structure top the competition for people. So you hack
        other people and you get points and it's really fun. But the other thing is, which we didn't do last year, is I want
        to do a sub-group of the ACM, which is geared towards Cyber Security, so we can learn about different stuff with
        Networks, and Network security, and things of that variety.
<Juan Enters the Room>
Jonah: Well, Come on in. I told them that the Linux User group is awesome.
Juan: Yeah that's great, come on.
Andrea: This is Juan.
Jonah: What we will be having is a seperate meeting time every week for the Cyber Security stuff, and then after that, There is
        also the IC2 meetings, and they require a $15.00 dues after the first meeting. But they're pretty cool, and they have
        speakers that talk about several different things, so you should go to those.
Jonah: For the HAcking competition, I need two types of people. Those that are interested in setting it up, and those that are
        interested in competing, and we will have more information if you sign up for the mailing list.
Andrea: Yeah, so if you come up front you can put your name and email address up here, and we'll put you on that mailing list.
<Clapping in the room>
