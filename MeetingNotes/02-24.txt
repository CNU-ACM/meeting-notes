Meeting Notes for February 24, 2015

Meeting Start
*************

Andrea: Dues will be due next year, in August around.
AndreaThank you for braving all the snow and ice out there, I know there's a lot. I almost slipped once, but it didn't happen.

Jonah: David slipped a couple times.

Andrea: I wqould like to speak about replay for life, but I don't know anything about that, and Mr. Harrah is not here so we'll be skipping that one.
Andrea: So just assume that we'll be skipping that one, and just be on alert since it might be tomorrow or something.

Jacob: No, I asked him, I think it's in March or something like that.

Youtube Speaker
***************

Andrea: Okay so It's in march sometime aparently.
Andrea: Everyone seems to be much more interested in this youtube speaker, and I have atleast one video of each of the speakers.
Andrea: There are a few of these speakers that I couldn't finish the videos for. Mostly the Call of Duty Max ones, and some others.
        There were a few videos that I liked, and unfortunately a lot of them were overseas, so I'd need to go talk to the OSA, and
        see how much of a travel budget I could get. But we'll see what's going on there.
Jacob: Have you sent him an email, he's on really weird hours right now. Just because maybe you could do a video chat live.
Andrea: We'll see what happens.
Jacob: I'm just saying, you know it might be easier for him, and for us.

 *-> Time spent looking at each of the videos that were noticed. <-*
 
 Andrea: So I don't think we need to worry about that for right now, we will know more next week.

IC2
***

Andrea: So for the IC2
(Jonah corrects title)

Andrea: Yeah, so they are meeting Tomorrow at 7:00. They will be going over more cyber security topics. They have a Keynote.
        I don't think you need to have dues for this one, but I think that you do need to have them for the next one.
Jonah: Yeah, not for this one.
        But if you bring $15.00 then it helps to pay for free pizza that's there for people who go.
Karl: Wait, we have a cyber security club?
Jonah: No, they are a group that hosts these things on campus.
Andrea: If you go to the event you'll see alot of familiar faces because a lto of professors go, so keep that in mind.

RedHat Speaker
**************

Andrea: Okay so the Red Hat speaker is coming for Pizza My Mind at 11:00 AM. So go to that, rmeember it's in Freeman 202. This         is all in Freeman. Just look around until you find it, It wont be that hard.
        You're allowed to ask anything except about employment. I encourage you to ask questions that touch as close to that          as possible, without actually hitting on that--
(interupted) Jonah: No, because He's going to do a Pizza My Mind afterwards, and that's where you can ask about employment.                       This is going to be strictly towards a lecture type thing.
Karl: If by employment you mean us getting jobs there, not asking about his job alone.
Jonah: Right. Just don't be like: "Hey You have any internships?" No don't be that guy.


Minecraft Server
****************

Andrea: Minecraft server is still up I think.
Jonah: I heard Juan got addicted the other day. He was supposed to give up, and stay for an hour, and he stayed for like 5 hours.
Andrea: Addicted?
Jonah: Yeah.
        Some people got on the server and it put them hell-a-far away from everyone else.

IEEE/ACM Server Access
**********************

Andrea: Also now in Rap Hall, you can now access the IEEE/ACM servers, and Defender from the ethernet.
(YAY, errupts in the room)
Jacob: Is that the entire building?
Andrea: Yes.
Jacob: Awesome.
Andrea: It turns out they had Rappahanoc blocked for some reason.


Ferguson Speaker
****************

Andrea: Okay, our Ferguson speaker is coming in on the 6th, of the month after next (April)
Andrea: Okay, so that's all we've got, If you guys have any more speaker ideas, I would like to have them, because I would            like to beat CAB, at this, and it would be nice to have input. Okay, have a good day.
