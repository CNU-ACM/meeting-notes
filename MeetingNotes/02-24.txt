Meeting Notes for February 24, 2015

Andrea: Dues will be due next year, in August around.
AndreaThank you for braving all the snow and ice out there, I know there's a lot. I almost slipped once, but it didn't happen.

Jonah: David slipped a couple times.

Andrea: I wqould like to speak about replay for life, but I don't know anything about that, and Mr. Harrah is not here so we'll be skipping that one.
Andrea: So just assume that we'll be skipping that one, and just be on alert since it might be tomorrow or something.

Jacob: No, I asked him, I think it's in March or something like that.

Andrea: Okay so It's in march sometime aparently.
Andrea: Everyone seems to be much more interested in this youtube speaker, and I have atleast one video of each of the speakers.
Andrea: There are a few of these speakers that I couldn't finish the videos for. Mostly the Call of Duty Max ones, and some others.
        There were a few videos that I liked, and unfortunately a lot of them were overseas, so I'd need to go talk to the OSA, and
        see how much of a travel budget I could get. But we'll see what's going on there.
Jacob: Have you sent him an email, he's on really weird hours right now. Just because maybe you could do a video chat live.
Andrea: We'll see what happens.
Jacob: I'm just saying, you know it might be easier for him, and for us.

 *-> Time spent looking at each of the videos that were noticed. <-*
 
 Andrea: So I don't think we need to worry about that for right now, we will know more next week.
