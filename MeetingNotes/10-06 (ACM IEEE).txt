Meeting Notes for 3rd of October, 2015

Andrea: Okay, lets go... Just normal stuff today to look at.
Andrea: Our treasurer isn't here so I'll skip that and come back to it.

Homecoming - ACM Representative
*******************************
Andrea: So i sent an email to everyone, and I wanted people to respond to...
        (Some talking over her) I generally wanted Juniors and Seniors to respond for the Homecoming event.
        If you did not respond, and you are a Junior or Senior, are an ACM member, 
        and have payed your dues... please look for that email, so you can represent the ACM.

David: James...
Andrea: Waht?
David: James Tobin is up there, but he's not here.
Andrea: Yes, but he responded to the email, so it's fine.
        I will also give some extra time to those who ahve decided to scoff the ACM.
Jacob: Maybe we should just move through each person, and those that aren't here just skip them.
Andrea: That too...
