Meeting Notes for 6th of October, 2015

Andrea: Okay, lets go... Just normal stuff today to look at.
Andrea: Our treasurer isn't here so I'll skip that and come back to it.

Homecoming - ACM Representative
*******************************
Andrea: So i sent an email to everyone, and I wanted people to respond to...
        (Some talking over her) I generally wanted Juniors and Seniors to respond for the Homecoming event.
        If you did not respond, and you are a Junior or Senior, are an ACM member, 
        and have payed your dues... please look for that email, so you can represent the ACM.
<List of people up on screen>
David: James...
Andrea: Waht?
David: James Tobin is up there, but he's not here.
Andrea: Yes, but he responded to the email, so it's fine.
        I will also give some extra time to those who ahve decided to scoff the ACM.
Nigel: Maybe we should just start without him and then whenever we get to this segment we just skip it.
Andrea: That's a good plan.
Nigel: I'm okay with that.
Andrea: Okay, so today, it's just normal things. If you've ever done homecoming before, you probably know it's going on.
        But if you're like most of us in the ACM you probably didn't know that you could do these things before, and then you got an
        email about it which is why you've decided to do it. Because you want to do a Revenge of the Nerds style thing. So I have
        made a list of all the people who are eligeble to go, and we will be voting starting when I send the email, ending thursday,
        lets say midnight. And whoever we do vote for, I will be giving them all the forms they need, and everything. We want to run
        a hearts and minds grassroots campaign, and really pull the vote for us out of this.
Nigel: So, just so you know how this works. Each organization is allowed to put up one candidate, up, and the candidate you basically
        you apply ... 
Andrea: And they maybe say that you can run.
Nigel: And then they decide.. who decides it?
Andrea: It's class council who decides it.
Nigel: Yes, they decide who of all of the candidates they pick five guys and five girls, and it's based on scholarship, leadership, and
        other criteria that they pick relating to the Christopher Newport University community.
Andrea: And we all have that. All of us, every single one of us... I'm sure... <Nigel: Yeah> So, We'll worry about that later.
        Um, first things first, we need to know who we want to choose, so send me your application, and we'll get right on that.
Nigel: Also, when you choose somebody you should consider...
Andrea: Yeah, you should choose someone who has a lot of scholarship, and a lot of... I don't know... Super Powers...
Nigel: Yeah! Something like that.
Andrea: Okay, but also, for anyone else, you have to decide what things you're interested in doing for homecoming, because they
        have four major events, that we win points for if you do them well, and in the end, who ever has the most points wins a
        trophy. I don't know what the trophies are, but I know that I like trophies, and I like winning. And the ACM could do 
        with some trophies and winning. <Nigel: I think there's five> There might be five, but I see four.
David: Oh wow that works!
Andrea: Um, there is the...
Nigel: You don't have midnight madness on there.
Andrea: Midnight Madness? What's that?
Nigel: It's on the 23rd.
Andrea: I don't think that's ... I don't think midnight madness is a point schedule.
Nigel: I highly encourage... You should get it.
Andrea: Okay, so I don't know what midnight madness is, but if I don't I'll add it to this list. Which will be in the link, in the
        email. So yell like hell, you make chants and a lot of noise. Spirit signs are when you paint images on plywood. Stage night
        is you have to become improv masters, and I guess make a skit thing, and there's the golf cart parade where you have to
        decorate a tiny vehicle. Which is lots of fun. Also if we decide on the golfcart one, then someone has to get golfcart training.
Haley: Golf cart training?
Andrea: Yes, Golf cart training.
Nigel: You have to train?
Andrea: Yeah you have to be trained in the operation of golf carts. So, the more I know, the more you know. So, there's these four
        great events, um, and you get points based on how well you do them. This works better than it really should. So you get
        points, and then the organization with the most gets the prize. And we want the prize obviously. Yeah? Who wants the prize?
        Show up hands! Keep them down if you don't want prizes. Yeah, I mean, if we could just get a person or two per event, that
        would be excellent, and we's get all the points.
        
LAN-Party
*********
Andrea: Okay, so the LAN Party as you all know is going to be on Halloween, most of you said CS GO and TF2. Some of you got
        confusede and put CS:GO as the pay game, and TF2 as the not-pay-game... So I don't know if there's liek a free 
        CS:GO that you guys have mysteriously found somewhere on the internet. 
Nigel: I Think that's if you play the origional Team Fortress.
Andrea: Well, why play the origional Team Fortress? Anyway, the LAN Party is going to be on Halloween, and there's posters everywhere.
        They don't say IEEE but...
David: They should.
Andrea: So, That's still on, and it's too late. We wasted all those print funds. We can put the IEEE up on a post-it note, and do that.
David: Yeah, because Jonah told Mikaela to put it only ACM. 
Andrea: Alright, well, next time that will not be an oversight, if I do not oversee it.

ACM@CNU Elections
*****************
Andrea: So, Elections thingy is coming up and, You should start thinking about nominations as all. But that's all I've got.

David: Yeah, I've been trying to get people to go to the LAN Party, and they think you have to play one specific game.
        And look who's here.
<Jonah walks in>
Nigel: Hey, we just finished, thank you!
Andrea: Yeah, so we're Done:

IEEE POrtion of the meeting
***************************
Nigel: Yeah, the IEEE has just about nothing, um, we're not going to do homecoming stuff, because if we split people between
        the ACM and the IEEE...
Andrea: We'll never win!
Nigel: Nobody will win! 

Internet of Things Project
**************************
Nigel: Yeah, The internet of things project I got a few reponses on. I'll send out a nother email, and I don't want to do a project and only have two people show up. So, that's about it.
