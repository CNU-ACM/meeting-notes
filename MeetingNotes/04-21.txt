Meeting notes for 21 April, 2015

Andrea: Okay, so I know there has been a switch around with the schedules: we do not have a meeting tomorrow,
        even though ti's tuesday thursday schedule.

IC2 Meeting
***********

Andrea: There is however, and IC2 Meeting tomorrow. THey are talking about security your personal computer, and you should go.
Jonah: It's a lot of fun. Free food, that your $15.00 pays for.

Club Fair
*********

Andrea: And on another note, lets not forget about club fair, because freshman need not know what they are doing here when they
        come by next year. I know that all of you are involved in something.
Nigel: UAS people, need to be there as well, please.
Andrea: So these people don't know what we are doing, they don't know what we are getting at, and we need to impress them.
        We can make something for the ACM. Make it sparkly and glittery and make it real pretty.
Jonah: We need to do something with computers. Lets bring a quadcopter in.
Andrea: As we get closer to club fair, we need to organize this, so we can catch smiling freshman, and recruit them.
        ACM is starting up in highschools in Hampton Roads. If we want to partner up with them, we would have to help out with
        currently inactive groups of two other Universities.
Richard: Thought it was William and MAry and someone else, I don't remember.
Andrea: Probably Thomas Nelson was the other one. I'll have to look.
Gerald: Last I checked though, William and Mary was active, although I think they're smaller than us right now.
Jonah: What?
Andrea: So we need volunteers who are willing to transfer to help out with other ACM groups in the area.
Jonah: I don't care, I'll go to William and Mary.
Jacob: I might be next year might be-- (laughs)
Jonah: Do we really want to do anything with ODU?
Andrea: Yeah, if they bring us Money.
        If we can ask them to set up some sort of giant carnival event then that would be good.
Jacob: Like a giant Lan Party. A huge Lan Party.
Andrea: I like that idea too.
Gerald: I mean, there are some pretty big Lan Parties that are thrown around the world, so if we can get something bigger,
        by all means.


Lan Party
*********

Andrea: Yeah, so that ebing said, aparently you guys wanted a Lan party this week on the 25th. I don't belive you guys.
        If we want to do it we can do it.
Jonah: Yeah because I thought it was a reading day, and that was going to leave us free for that night.
Mason: There are study sessions though.
Karl: What about exams? Nigel: We can meet later (Same time)
Andrea: There aren't exams on that day.
Jacob: Yeah, it's sunday so--
Gerald: You can't schedule an event now, because it's finals. When finals start all club events have to stop.
        If I'm not mistake, you might want to double check that.
Nigel: So why don't we just do an online Lan Party? A virtual Lan Party.

Minecraft Server
****************

Andrea: Okay so we have our Minecraft server running, and if you want to go on it, you can go on it. 
Jonah: Yay.
Jacob: What if you're not on--
Nigel: I think you have to be on campus.
Andrea: Yeah, if you're on Campus, the it's already set up for you to go.
Richard: Can we figure out a way to put it forward together so that--
Nigel: Andrea wants to set it up over ssh.
Andrea: I can, but I'm Lazy.
Jacob: Who here has not had a reply to?
Andrea: Also I don't have the password to the server so there's that.
Jackie: Does Nigel Know about that?
Andrea: Yeah, Mr. Nigel is going to help you with that.

Fundraising
***********

Andrea: last thing we have. Mr. Lazer...
Jonah: That's me!
Andrea: How much money have we made over the fundraiser.
Jonah: That is a famortastic question Andrea. And the answer to that is that we still have that--
<Someone puts one dollar infront of Jonah>
Jonah: Thank you! So we have one dollar!
Jackie: 17 lashes for your incompetence.
Jonah: What?
Jonah: Yeah, so I figured I'd go talk to OSA about flipping the table.
Andrea: Yes, I want a fundraiser.

Andrea: So, that's all.
