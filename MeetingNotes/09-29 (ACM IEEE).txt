Meeting start
*************

Andrea: Okay so there are like two major things. And we can't just wait for Mr. Lazer to show up.
Andrea: The Lan Party, which is on Halloween. I've wanted it to be an FPS oriented one, but if 
        you really hate FPS games, you can suggest a game that isn't an FPS--
Nigel: Or you can just come and play it yourself.
Andrea: The form this time is labeled: You get one choice for a game that is free, and one choice for a game that is not free.
        So I want to have two major games going. One that anyone can play and one that hopefully a lot of people have already
        bought, so hopefully we can have two major games going.
David: Borderlands--
Andrea: For pay?
David: Yeah--but--
Andrea: There's like four people that have it.
David: Yeah...
Nigel: You can always just play it yourself. We're not going to stop you.
Andrea: I will wag my finger.
Nigel: Just play it on one of the computers or something.
David: I'll bring my own computer.
Andrea: I will bring a stop sign.

Speaker Sessions
****************

Andrea: Moving on! I would like to bring in a speaker from a company who can come and show up and show us what they do.
        So if you guys have any connections, and you want to host somebody. Just email us, and we'll see what we can do.
Jacob: What about Google like last year?
Andrea: We already did that. I mean-- If you want to bring in google we can. I mean, if you really want to work at Google.
        I mean, if your heart is set on Google, you want to work at Google, and you wear google t-shirts every day. Yeah--
        Otherwise, there is a form, that you will see in a little bit--
<Nigel Applies Google Swag>
David:: Yes. Google swag.
Andrea: Google Swag?
Nigel: Yeah, you see the thing that these glasses do that google glass doesn't is protect you from the sun.
Andrea: Okay! I was thinking about companies such as Occulus. Companies that want to do something really cool. Companies
        that just want to do something absolutely amazing.
Andrea: You are late!
        Yeah, so you should just put your favorite company who does that one thing in that box.
Joey: Tesla
Andrea: Yeah, so I am going to pass it off to Mr. Jonah Lazar for fundraising.

Fundraising
***********
Nigel: Now, you may explain why we have no money.
Joey: Literally...
<Jonah was absent>

IEEE Portion
************

Nigel: Okay so I took a look at the dues that you need to pay, and I actually don't remember them being this cheap.
        They're about $32.00, so if you want dues for the club, get them now.
        They're still larger than the ACM.
        Pretty much any major Engineer recognizes the IEEE, and the majority of them are members. So when you put that on a 
        resume, and you let people know of that, they do recognize it. It's not something where they don't know what it is.
        
        Also, we are looking-- I sent out something about an internet of things project, and I didn't recieve anything.
        I'm kind of assuming there's no intrest, so if you want that to happen,a nd you are intrested, email ieee@cnu.edu 
        and--
    
    <Jonah Walks in>
    <Andrea and Nigel call out "Late!">
Nigel: You already missed your time to shine. We had a mommnet for you to stand up, and we called out Mr. Lazar, and
        you didn't stand up, so you've missed your time to speak.
Jonah: Well did you pronounce it correctly.
Andrea: Lazer!
Jonah: I don't have anything to say so--
Andrea: Yes you do! I want money!
Jonah: Oh right, I'm still the treasurer aren't I.
<laughter breaks out>

Nigel: So if you're interested in doing an IEEE interent of things project, talk to me or preferably send an email to
        ieee@cnu.edu and get that there.


Fundraising Continued*
*********************

Andrea: I would literally just mine at this point.
Joey: Doge Coins
Andrea: Yes! I would, I would.
Nigel: If I set one up on the server would you accept that?
Andrea: What? --
Jonah: For fundraising.
<Person: We could have like ACM coins.>
Andrea: Ooo...
        Starting your own type of coins is a bad plan. You know what happens? You know you put it out there, and then people 
        buy it for like 3 minutes, and then it crashes.
Jonah: Yeah, but we could try Bitcoins right?
Andrea: No!!!
Jonah: Um, may I?
Andrea: YES!!!
Jonah: I'm not going to stand up though.
Andrea: Turn around! (Jonah: What?)
        Turn Around!
Jonah: I'm talking to you aren't I?
Jonah: So you know how last year we were going to do the whole like, smash technology for money...
        With the table, so I don't think we should flip a table, and I think we should do the actual smash old <*excplicit> 
        technology, for a dollar, with a baseball bat. And it turns out that Jake and Jake's cousin Cortland, so they have
        a lot of old technology that they're trying to give away--
Nigel: I think people would enjoy smashing keyboards in half.
Jonah: Yeah, so, they have a bunch of old technology that they are willing to donate to us.
        As well as broken peices of equiptment aparently, so, yeah, is that it?
        Yeah, so that's an idea, that I think we will look at around finals week.
        Also Richard is here with a new beard...
Richard: I went to Alaska. 

Lan Party
*********

Nigel: Yeah, so if you want to design a poster for the Lan Party, we need one for next week. So if someone could
        do that please. We're not begging but please. Someone design something better than the crappy poster I did last year.
Jonah: Michaela could do it.
David: Yeah, I'll ask her.
    <Discussion about the poster>
Andrea: Okay, so um, I just forgot to do something.
Jonah: You're removing Gerald...
Nigel: Hasn't he met up with you like four fricken times, he's showed up to a majority of the meetings.
Jonah: Yeah he has.
David: Whay does he come?
Andrea: Nobody knows.  Jonah: Because he has no life.
Andrea: So, if you want to make a poster today, or if you can get your freind to email it to me today, that would be great!
Nigel: And you only have to be more creative than the majority of people in this room.
David: Yeah there's like an art major or minor living in the theme unit I'm in.
Andrea: You're in a theme unit? -- David: Yeah...
Andrea; I'm so sorry.
David: I chose to be in one.
Andrea: I know, and you made the wrong choice.


Andrea: So anyway, We are done here... get out!
