Lan Party
*********
<Question: Can we have single player games, I remember something being said about-->
Nigel: Well, we will have single player games there, but we like more for people to have multiplayer games, so we might--
Andrea: Yeah, you can play, but we generally ask that you do something with someone else.
<Question: What if we don't have Minecraft?>
Andrea: You can--
Nigel: You can play single player maybe, or another game if you want, we generally pick minecraft because everyone has it, and
        people play it a lot.
Andrea: Or you can borrow a login from someone.
Jonah: What about if we want to use an occulus rift?
Andrea: Well, we have two Occulus Rifts, yeah I will ask if you really want them. But do you really want that sort of thing.
Nigel: Do you want any of the other clubs to come over?
Andrea: I was thinking about it, and I will ask them.
Nigel: Yeah, so we do try to get other clubs, typically we do allow other clubs to join in.
        We atleast get Nintendo club to show up.

Andrea: Also, bring power strips, because that's necissary.
        Okay, if you want to game to run on the Windows computers, I have a form attached to the email I sent, where you can
        Sign up to have that done for you. Just say that you'd like to have a specific game.

Jonah: End of Fall Sememster last year.
Andrea: Then you're good for this semester. But for others, remember, it's $19.99, it's a nice membership.
Nigel: It's half the price of the IEEE Membership.
Andrea: There's that.
<Question: Where do I go to get that Membership?>
Andrea: The link is on the compass, under the news section.
Nigel: If you just google: 'ACM Student Membership' You'll find it.

Mailing List and Compass
************************

Andrea: Okay, there is also this cool new form,which tells me which mailing list you'd like to be on. SO if you want to be on
        the cyber security mailing list, then you go and check, YES, I want to be on the Cyber Security Mailing list.
        It's wonderful, you should try it, you should join. Which you will be given information if you join.
Jonah: So yeah, the email I'm going to send out is going to be a doodle poll to find out when we are going to have the meeting
        So if you're on the mailing list, look out for that email. It'll also contain some stuff we are going to do for our
        initial meeting. So look out for that, and I hope to see you at our first meeting soon. Whenever it is.

***********
Andrea: Ohhh! One last thing. Minecraft mods. So we are probably goign to use minecraft with the same faction modsa s we did
        last time, that was really fun. My faction did the best ofcourse. So if you were thinking of any other mods that would
        contribute, just send your ideas to acm@cnu.edu, and we can get that done as well,a nd put it in one of the games.
        Okay, we'll pass it onto Nigel...

IEEE Portion
============

Nigel: Okay, Hi, The sign up for IEEE Membership is $40.00. I know it's more expensive but the good thing about it is that if 
        you go to a job, and you have IEEE membership, it's totally recognized by the employer, and as mentioned last time, 
        you have access to an extremely comprehensive library of computing and engineering papers.
        And Every real Engineer, knows about the IEEE if they're not already a member. And people, buy membership so they can
        put it on their resume alone.
        I'll be sending the link out to get everyone signed up with that.
Andrea: Yeah, so if you find anything wrong in my eamils--
Nigel: Or my eamils.
Andrea: Yeah, just let me know, and I will buy you a doughnut. Unless you're allergic to doughnuts.
Nigel: I won't do that.
Andrea: Neato, so any questions?

Questions
*********

Jonah: For Nigel, So What are we doing in the IEEE this year?
Nigel: I'd like to start and internet of things project. I'm sure you've all heard of the Internet of Things... So there's
        this awesome little circuit board call the ESP-266. It's super-cheap, it's like $3.00. And it's got a WiFi card on
        it. You can program it in Lua, and It's super easy to get on with it. I was thinking about continuing the project
        from last year but I don't know how... I don't think so-- (Jonah: What project?)
        We were building a clock.
Andrea: What?
Nigel: We were building an LED Clock, and we designed it, but I don't know how we're going to finish that.
Andrea: Would you be willing to ressurect Aquarius?
Nigel: Aquarius? I don't know what that is.
Andrea: Does anyone know what Aquarius is?
        Okay, so 3 years ago the remnants of Aquarius was ll that was left, it was an old PCC computer, so the ACM/IEEE took
        it and dumped it in a pool of mineral oil, and called it liquid cooling. It was a nice little experiement. He could
        do it, it was really fun. Maybe try something other than the PCC. Get a large fish tank, and a lot of mineral oil...
Nigel: Hmm, that could work, that could work--
Andrea: Yeah, mostly, the problem was that the fish tank seals were made of silicon, and the mineral oil ate through it.
        It made a mess.
Jonah: So what you're saying is... We need a Computer to Destroy.
Andrea: Yeah, maybe, okay, if that's all, we are done.
