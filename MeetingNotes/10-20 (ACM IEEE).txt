Meeting for 20th of October, 2015

Richard: Okay, so I'm actually going to start the meeting now, because I actually don't know when
          it's supposed to start. I'll read my emails. Alright well thanks for the notice. For those of you who don't know me,
          I am richard, I am the Vice Chair of the ACM, but I'm not a full time student, and that's because I work full time,
          and I.. <Jonah: Clearly not!> So I don't always have the opportunity to take 2 hours off of my work schedule to come here,
          because I work down in Norfolk. Now fo those of you who do know me, I'm very sorry, I do, I apologize.
Nigel: You're sorry that we know you?
Richard: I'm sorry that you know me, I'm sorry that you've seen my face, I'm sorry for the holocaust, what else you want me
          to apologize for?
Jonah: We as in the Jews.
Richard: And the Gypsies, and the gypsies, we covered that last night.
Jonah: This morning.
Richard: Wow time flies by when you're not having fun. Andrea Is not here today, she was going to take somebody to something, but
          whatever, it's Andrea. Who knows what she does? So she wanted me to read off the announcements.
Nigel: Just in case you don't read your email.
Richard: Yeah just incase you just don't read it.
Jonah: That's pretty much all these meetings are anyways. Reading an email.

LAN Party
*********
Richard: Just a reminder we have our LAN Party on halloween, at 7:00. So If you really want to have fun, come dressed in your best
          halloween costume.
Jonah: There will be a contest and prizes.
Nigel: If you really don't want to have fun. Don't come dressed in a costume, and don't show up.
Jonah: What about extra costumes?
Richard: We will have costumes for rent, that I will put you in whether you like it or not.
<Person1>: They will all be my little pony.
Richard: They will be spooky.
<Person2>: We should dress like you for halloween.
Jonah: yes, everyone dress like me.
Richard: yeah, so we've got scheduled CS:GO, and TF2 ready for the computers in the creech. So we are going to have both games installed
        with a minecraft server running, bring your laptops, computers, freinds. Please bring freinds, so that we are not all alone
        in this.
Jonah: We should dress up as Professors for Halloween. I call Dr. Siochi.

Sprirt Sign
***********
Richard: So, todays afternoon challenge for the homecoming challenge, is the spirit sign, do you want to do a painted QRCode or the
          ACM logo.. But we are currently deciding what to put on the QRCode for the logo. I am currently in favor of instantcena.com
          being the ad.
Nigel: Yes, Yes!
Richard: Although people are in favor of a rick rolled being linked.
Haley: No.
Richard: I'll show you what instant cena is before I leave, just so you know what the glory is. And as Andrea so gloriously put it:
        There is Nothing else. She is going to put out some...
Richard: wait... she wrote there is nothing else... <scrolls down> ... But wait there's more... She was talking to someone from
          Tesla, people involved with the ACM, so there's a standalone email from the ACM about tutors, so It's a bit spammy.
Jonah: It's very spammy.
Richard: So talk to her if you'd like to get involved with that. I ahve no idea...
Nigel: Aparently Andrea didn't make it into homecoming court.
Richard: No she didn't even make it past the first round.
Nigel: She made it past the application.
Jonah: Wait, is that who we nominated?
Nigel: Aparently.
Richard: She's just about the only person we have left to nominate so...

<    AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CEN-->
Nigel: If you're on Wifi it cuts out.
Richard: Anyway, that's my proposed link, so I need to actually get back to work, and let the jokes comence, so Jonah, or David, if
          you'd like to make Jokes while I leave feel free to make them at my expense. Nigel too...
