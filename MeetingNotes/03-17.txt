Meeting Notes for the ACM 17 March, 2015

Meeting Start
*************

Andrea: Okay, let's get started, We had a good time last week with everything.

Programming Competition
***********************

Andrea: The Programming Competition is coming up, that's on the 3rd of next month (April) So be prepared for that coming up.
(Confirmation with others in the room)
Andrea: So teams for that are getting ready to sign up, talk to Dr. Khoel for more information.
        Generally just pick two people you like, or think are decent at programming, and just go for it, and make a team. 
        And credit the ACM.
Nigel: Already done it.
Andrea: Who's on your team?
Nigel: Dan Ackerman.
Jonah: That's right he told me that... and...
Nigel: That's it. We don't want another person.
Jacob: You should want another person, that way one person codes, and the other one fights with everyone about everything.
Andrea: Right, so the programming competition is coming up, and I would like to see a bunch of people out there, and coding away.
        You have 7 problems or something and 3 hours in which to do them.
Nigel: And no google.
Andrea: That's right, and no internet access.
Nigel: If we could pull off that NCIS stuff...
Jonah, Yeh, we could just find a way to make it look like we're coding. Hackertyper.com, (brrr)...

Replay for Life
***************

Andrea: So, since we've lost Richard, I don't kow what's going on with Replay for life.
Jonah: Oh right, he told me that he quits and resigns his position.
Andrea: Yes, So Richard may or may not be coming back.
Jacob: You don't know where Richard is?
Andrea: No. We haven't heard from him at all.
        So we don't know what's going on with Replay for life, if you guys want to help
        out with that it would eb more than appreciated.
Gerald: If you guys do this online it's better but last time you were in dead last place with zero dollars though.
Nigel: We're not talking about donations though, we're talking about Replay for Life.
Andrea: Yeah, so if anyone is interestedin helping me out with that, I guess we have to start over from scratch,
        and that's how it is.
Nigel: I still remember the password for what he used to host it. For the Twitch account.
Andrea: Okay, so Nigels already making progress there.
Gerald: You guys have everything you need, you just have to figure out the setup for streaming stuff that you need as well.
        You have the domain, twitch account, and I have webserver space if you want, and uh--
(Interupted) Andrea: Honestly, what I would like from you, is a donation. How's $300.00?
Andrea: You can donate that, it's no problem. You make a lot of money in your rich, computer IT job.
Gerald: Okay maybe, at some point. (Laughs)
Andrea: Okay, so Mr. Nigel, I will be talking to you at some point, and we'll figure out where to go from there.
David: I can help out as well, at replay for life.
Andrea: Good, so we have lots of ridiculous ideas, about how to strap desks to people, for Replay for life, I would love to hear
        them, eamil me at acm@cnu.edu.


Fundraising
***********

Andrea: Okay so, fundraising...
Jonah: Oh that's uh... yeah... That's me isn't it.
      I have a monitor that we can destroy.
Andrea: Okay, well, have you made any progress? 
Jonah: Yes, I have a monitor that we can destroy.
Andrea: Good for you... Do you have a time? Table?
Jonah: Oh hell no, I don't know how to set that up.
        The one fundraiser I did Gerald set it up, and --
Andrea: Okay I will show you how to do it.
        It's pretty easy, you just have to go to the OSA.

Interest Stuff
**************

Andrea: So anyone have any business that is of interest to the ACM? Or me?
Jonah: We wrapped the movie shoot, that we're sponsoring.
Andrea: You dropped it?
Jonah: We wrapped it.
Andrea: Oh. That the ACM is sponsoring?
Jonah: Ofcourse.
Andrea: We're sponsoring a movie shoot?
Jonah: Hell yeah.
Andrea: I'm sure I did at some point. Can you tell me more about it.
Jonah: Yeah, we needed the Atrium, but only organizations can reserve the atrium.
Andrea: Oh, That's right.
        The same way you reserve the atrium, is the same way that you can host a fundraiser.
Jonah: Talk to Clare?
Andrea: Actually that is a main way of solving a super huge ammount of problems.
Nigel: Because the department can also reserve things.
Jonah: Okay, cool.

Lan Party
*********

Andrea: I am interested in doing one more Lan party before the school closes for the semester.
Jonah: How'd the last one go?
Andrea: (Sigh)
Nigel: I heard it was centered around minecraft.
Andrea: Yeah, we had like a half way full minecraft server, it was the best.
        Only thing is that VESPA took the creech at the same time, so that was one fo the only problems.
Jonah: Yeah, so what's going to happen, I heard Clare sent you a smiley face.
Andrea: Yeah, so I don't know what the reprocussions of this arte, but I know we are not affiliated with them.
Andrea: So the programming competition is on Friday, and we have a rather packed weekend.
Jonah: It's like an ACM weekend.
Nigel: I actualy wouldn't mind putting that on a poster. Call it the ACM weekend.
Andrea: So that's all for this week, you are dismissed.
