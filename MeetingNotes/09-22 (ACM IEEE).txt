Pre-meeting Pleasantries
************************

Andrea: Hello Everyone, so lets get started. Our mailing list is filled, and we have a lot of people in here.
        We get ost of this from the OSA. You can change stuff on there. Emails, Name, stuff like that.
Andrea: Yes? Hello... <Andrea answers phone>
Andrea: Anyway, with all these emails, I've been putting out of context quotes at the bottom of all these emails. I hope you
        enjoy them as much as I do. Lets just wait until more people show up.
Nigel: I notice how during class people always sit at the back, but during the meetings, people always sit towards the front.
Andrea: because we're friendly and nice, and I will give you an A in freindship if you sit at the front!
Jonah: Hey! I get an A in freindship.
<Andrea points at the back corner where Jackie sits>
Andrea: You fail! You may as well just turn around.
Jonah: This is some nasty mac and cheese.
Andrea: Yeah, that's because you went to the dining hall.

Meeting Start
*************

Andrea: Okay, so this Lan party... Flores... okay so, the Lan Party was super fantastic. We had three teams of Artemis, with
        a large number of people playing. We also had some people on Minecraft, just messing and wiggeling about on there.
Andrea: All shenanegans aside, it was a very entertaining Lan Party. I would like to start planning on the next Lan Party.
        I would like to switch it up, and try to base it on a less strategy type of thing. I was thinking CS-Go but not 
        everyone owns CS-Go. But I--
Nigel: I think TF2.
Andrea: Yeah, we could do TF2.
Nigel: And I think TF2, it still has a community, which I think is pretty amazing for a game that ahs been out as long as
        long as it has.
Jonah: They just came out with an entire Game-changing update like a month ago, so it's grown in popularity.
Nigel: Right, like so yeah.
<Question: Could we have multiple games going?>
Andrea: The question to the Lab's computer handle is proabably, yes.
        Those are work station-level computers.
Nigel: Yeah, the only question would be the graphics--
Andrea: They're quite impressive.
Jonah: And Flight Inside is pretty insane.
Andrea: Um... I will look into that.
        Good Call.
Nigel: Um, Also, for the Lan Party, next month Lan Party, We could totally use a really awesome poster.
        So if someone has some artistic skills or otherwise, and would like to design a poster, we could use one.
Jonah: I mean, we could print one.
Nigel: No we're not talking about that kind, we're talkin about 8'1/2 by 11' poster for it.
Andrea: And quarter size--
Nigel: and Quarter size fliers for the event as well, that we can put up in the residence corners.
Andrea: I don't know if maybe we could have just some kind of like, fantastic poster, that we could put up in the creech
        like three days before the Lan Party.
        But I would love to have something that is more than just the text: "Lan Party, Here, Friday" So, some nice little
        pictures, and some nice graphics.
Nigel: We can have something nice, some nice little circles and pictures, and squares.
Andrea: So we are going to try to do that for the next Lan Party.
Nigel: And part of that will also be, to get advertising up and good for it as well, for the next Lan Party.
Andrea: But no guns you can't put any guns on it.
Nigel: Mostly, we'll just be seeing if people can put up fliers and some posters and stuff up for us.
Andrea: Mostly fliers. But okay, good.


CNU Office of Sustainability
****************************

Andrea: Okay, so I was contacted by the CNU Office of sustainability, and they would love to have some free labor from
        the ACM, working on some sort of project with... They said: "Raspberry Pi". Yeah, so that's what most people say
        when they don't know what they want. So, I am going to go talk with What's-his-name? <Person Name: Ryan Fets(?)>
<Person(?) States: It's an arduino, it's a micro controller>
Nigel: Raspberry Pi is not a microcontroller though.
<Person(?): It's also a microcontroller though>
Nigel: Not really. (Andrea: It's a computer)
<Person(?): I'm serious. 
Nigel: Not really--
Jonah: You're seriously wrong.
Nigel: No... Yeah, it's really not.
Andrea: This is our Capstone, to make it work like one... What? The sustainability office wants free labor, I am going to give them what 
        they want. If you want to come with me... And learn more... because that is all I know. You can do so. Come
        talk to me afterwards, and we will figure out a time collectively.
Member in the Room: I talked with them yesterday, and it seemed like he didn't really know what he wanted with it.
Jonah: Yeah, so something with a Raspberry Pi.
Nigel: The first step--
Jonah: yeah..
Andrea: Be, okay...

Minecraft Server
****************
Andrea: So the Minecraft server that was up during Lan Party should still be up. At 'acm.cnuapps.me'. It will remain up until
        Juan decides that he is tired of using his free trial on it, and he takes it down.
        
        So I have some server-ish-esque boxes laying around at home. Which I am willing to set up at CNU, with a firewall, 
        and if anyone is interested in playing with server administration, and wants to try being a sys-admin, then, for 
        99.999% up time.
Nigel: Or if you want to we can actually set you up with a virtual Machine on the server that the ACM, and the IEEE actually
        own. It's sitting in the server rack doing absolutely nothing. We need to findthe password though, and then we have
        to work on getting it through some of the firewalls, which we have done previously, and we may be able to run games
        with.
Nigel: It worked everywhere on campus last time, which did take a little bit of doing. (Answering Question)
Andrea: Did we have it outward facing?
Nigel: We could work on that, we could try to get some things outward facing.
Andrea: If you would really love to take a look at all things sys-admin, please volunteer.

<people start running to the front>

Andrea: Ahh! Not all at once! Maybe after I dismiss you guys, you can form an orderly line, to sign up for free labor.
        And all the people who want to provide free labor for sustainability.
Nigel: And all the people who want to help out with advertising for the Lan Party.
Andrea: Yeah, posters.
Jonah: All the posters...

IEEE Portion: Internet of Things
********************************

Nigel: So the IEEE people have been looking at doing an Internet of Things thing...
Jonah: When you say people, you mean you right.
Nigel: No, I mean, I don't remember who asked, but people have been looking at that. So I think that the best way to do that
        would be to have a seperate meeting outside of this meeting, and we can talk about it. But I gotta figure out when
        poeple want to do it.So, I'll probably send out an E-mail.

Lan Party
*********

Andrea: So, next Lan Party, is kind of wierd, I would like to do it in about a Month-ish, the thing is we've got Fall recess
        on October the 9th, to the 13th. So, We can advertise before break, which means we would have to have everything ready
        By, next week, or we can delay it to the 13th and have a Halloween, Lan Party, I wont mandate costumes this time.
